      <p class="transcript">My biggest fear is that I… I don’t think it’s my biggest fear, but it’s a fear that I was born with because ever since I was a baby, I was so scared when things moved from the wind. For example, if a curtain would move from the wind, swing, or anything, I would start crying and I still have this fear up until now. If I see something moving from the wind on its own my stomach would start hurting me.</p>
