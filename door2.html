      <p class="transcript">One of the most consistent fears I’ve had is the fear of heights. (I) had it ever since I was really small. I don’t even really know why. I think it started because I used to fall from a lot of things when I was small. Like the top of a flight of stairs, the table (a lot), and ever since then I’ve had a huge fear of heights. I think that’s why I absolutely hate rollercoasters and like those really big slides in water parks; that feeling in the pit of your stomach is just not cool man.</p>
